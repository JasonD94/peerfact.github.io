### Disclaimer

This project is fairly new, so for now I am only accepting websites that are full on fake news sources. There needs to be some discussion on whether to include clickbait, misleading or satirical articles.

### Contributing

Here is a nice list someone has compiled over the last few days: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10eA5-mCZLSS4MQY5QGb5ewC3VAL6pLkT53V_81ZyitM/preview

I am only adding category 1 sites for now from that Google Doc.

To add a domain to the list please do the following:

1. Add an entry to the "fakenews" array in the hosts.json file. Please use the apex domain whenever possible. (IE example.com instead of www.example.com)
2. Add a file called DOMAIN.json under the hosts/ directory. You can copy another domain to get the format.

Let's create a more informed world together!
