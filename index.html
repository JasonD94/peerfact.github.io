      <h3>Project Details</h3>
      <p>The goal of PeerFact is to reduce the amount of misinformation that is present on social networks. People's opinions can be formed based on information they see on their social networks being shared by people they follow. I firmly believe that we have a moral imperative to ensure this information be factual to allow for a more informed public. This project is not meant to be partisan, it is meant to be factual.</p>
      
      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>The PeerFact plugin allows every post to be scrutanized by the public at large. If the post is not based in fact, then you may vote the post as not being factual along with a link to proof.</p>
